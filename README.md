# Solutions: What is this?

A select few popular math textbooks have solutions online. The purpose of this repo is twofold:
1. To colate those solutions in one awesome, easy to understand, fully explained, collaboratory document.
2. To colate the links to solution sets for perusal and completeness (especially those that are free and accessible online!)
